    <h2>Question-4</h2>

    <h4>This is the normal text.</h4>
    <div>Do not TRY to meditate. Trying to meditate is the biggest mistake people make. During meditation, just do
        nothing. It is very important to do absolutely nothing during meditation.</div>
        <hr>
    <h4>This is the text with "Big" class.</h4>
    <div class="Big">You learn to meditate by meditating. The silence and stillness you experience in meditation and the
        increased happiness and diminished stress you experience outside meditation are so attractive and welcomed that
        you naturally teach yourself how to go deeper into that silence and stillness each time you meditate.
    </div>
    <hr>
    <h4>This is the text with "Big" class and "p" tag.</h4>
    <p class="Big">Meditate every morning and every evening for 15-30 minutes. It is best to meditate before you eat.
        Try to meditate in a quiet place but if you do not have a quiet place to meditate that is okay. Noise is not a
        barrier to meditating. </p>
